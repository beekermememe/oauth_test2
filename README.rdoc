== Welcome to an oauth playground :)

This application is simply a playground to test out the integration of various omniauth strategies.

The pattern I follow is:
(1) Add a new strategy to the user model
(2) Integrate the strategy enabling the user to enable/disable authentication
(3) Use the authenticated API to provide a sample of the services available / hide this if the auth for that service is disabled

I am following alot of what Ryan Bates goes over in this screencasts, so no rocket science on my part, just plagerism :)
